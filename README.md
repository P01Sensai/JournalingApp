## ‚úÖ Usability Heuristics Focus

The app incorporates Jakob Nielsen‚Äôs 10 Usability Heuristics:

1. **Visibility of System Status:**  
   Feedback is given for saving, loading, and deleting entries.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World:**  
   Uses familiar concepts like a calendar and timestamps to reflect real-world journaling.

3. **User Control and Freedom:**  
   Users can delete entries and navigate back to the home screen freely.

4. **Consistency and Standards:**  
   Icons, layout, and interactions follow common mobile app conventions.

5. **Error Prevention:**  
   The app restricts empty entries and confirms key actions, reducing potential errors.

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:**  
   Journal entries are clearly labeled with unique IDs and timestamps.

7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:**  
   Users can mark memorable entries as favorites and access them quickly.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:**  
   The interface uses a clean, light design with clear spacing for readability and focus.

9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:**  
   Simple error messages are logged to the console to assist in debugging.

10. **Help and Documentation:**  
   This README provides clear onboarding instructions and guidance.
